## Hi, I'm Jay


I am an Algorithmic Trading Developer from the Philippines. My work focuses on translating trading research and strategies into trading algorithms in live market conditions, and developing risk management tools, primarily through the MetaTrader platform. 


I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics Engineering, which allowed me to build an intuition for problem solving. This has led me to develop a strong passion for studying Financial Markets and generating systematic trading solutions across various asset classes.
